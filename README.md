Mounting hardware and electronics for NDB7875 diode and LulzBot Taz. 

Specifically designed for NDB7875 diode and LulzBot Taz. Maximum output power is 3W, and 50um/2mil line widths have been achieved (see "Photos/07-PrecisionEngraveTest.jpg". Large quantities of ~3mm thick wood shutter slats have been trimmed with this setup, and many solder paste stencils have been rendered.

Please consider using a BDR-209 laser for extra precision and better concentration. Future development will concentrate on precision and sensor functionality rather than power.

# Safety
Big scary laser. Do not examine with remaining eye. Seriously.

High-power, Class 4 near-UV lasers, such as NDB7875 are extraordinarily hazardous. Backscatter from the projected spot alone is sufficient to slice a retina. Avoid exposure, and wear eye protection.

Beware common grounding and other issues may falsely trigger the control transistor. In general, the laser system should be consiered dangerous whenever powered, particularly when the "SAFETY" switch is closed.

No claim of liability is made by anyone. Your accident is your accident. Use common sense, and follow all regulations. If you don't understand the safety features and limitations, don't use this circuit or anything similar.
